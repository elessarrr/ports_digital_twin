# Learnings from Debugging and Development

## Error 9: StreamlitDuplicateElementsError - Duplicate Button Elements

### Symptom
- **Error**: `StreamlitDuplicateElementsError: There are multiple button elements with the same auto-generated ID. When this element is created, it is assigned an internal ID based on the element type and provided parameters. Multiple elements with the same type and parameters will cause this error.`
- **Context**: Error occurred on the Vessel Insights tab when two "ðŸ”„ Refresh Data" buttons were present without unique keys.
- **Location**: Lines 946 and 1178 in `src/dashboard/streamlit_app.py`

### Root Cause
- **Identical Button Parameters**: Two `st.button("ðŸ”„ Refresh Data", help="Download latest vessel data from Hong Kong Marine Department")` calls in the same tab (tab3) had identical text and parameters.
- **Missing Unique Keys**: Streamlit generates internal IDs based on element type and parameters. Without explicit `key` parameters, both buttons received the same auto-generated ID.
- **Tab Consolidation Impact**: This issue emerged after consolidating the Strategic tab content into other tabs, which moved the "Live Vessel Arrivals" section (with its refresh button) into the same tab as the existing "Vessel Analytics Dashboard" refresh button.

### Resolution
Applied unique `key` parameters to differentiate the buttons:

1. **First Button (Vessel Analytics Dashboard)**: Added `key="refresh_vessel_analytics"`
   ```python
   if st.button("ðŸ”„ Refresh Data", help="Download latest vessel data from Hong Kong Marine Department", key="refresh_vessel_analytics"):
   ```

2. **Second Button (Live Vessel Arrivals)**: Added `key="refresh_live_arrivals"`
   ```python
   if st.button("ðŸ”„ Refresh Data", help="Download latest vessel data from Hong Kong Marine Department", key="refresh_live_arrivals"):
   ```

### Debugging Process Followed
1. **Error Diagnosis**: Identified the specific buttons causing the conflict through regex search
2. **Error Correction**: Added unique keys to resolve the immediate issue
3. **Full File Review**: Checked entire file for syntax errors and other potential duplicates
4. **Full Directory Review**: Verified no other active files had similar conflicts
5. **Dependency Analysis**: Confirmed no external dependencies were affected by the key changes
6. **Testing**: Verified fix through application preview

### Prevention Strategies
- **Always use unique keys**: For any Streamlit elements that might be duplicated, especially buttons, inputs, and widgets
- **Consistent naming convention**: Use descriptive keys that indicate the element's purpose and location
- **Code review focus**: Pay special attention to element uniqueness during tab consolidation or content reorganization

### Key Learnings
- Streamlit's auto-generated IDs are based on element type and parameters, not location in code
- Tab consolidation can introduce unexpected element conflicts
- Unique keys are essential for maintaining element identity across complex layouts
- The error-fixing process should be systematic and documented for future reference

## Error 8: Streamlit Cloud Path Duplication in `exec()` Context

### Symptom
- **Error**: `FileNotFoundError` with a duplicated path component when running in Streamlit Cloud.
- **Example**: `/mount/src/ports/Ports_23Aug_v2.2_demo_working_streamlit_optimised/hk_port_digital_twin/Ports_23Aug_v2.2_demo_working_streamlit_optimised/streamlit_app.py`
- **Context**: This error occurred when the application was deployed to Streamlit Cloud, but not locally.

### Root Cause
- **`exec()` and `__file__`**: The use of `exec()` to run the dashboard script from a different entry point (`streamlit_app.py`) caused confusion in how the `__file__` attribute was resolved within the executed code.
- **Hardcoded Path Resolution**: The dashboard script used `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3]` to find the project root. This assumed a fixed directory structure that was not consistent between the local environment and the Streamlit Cloud environment.
- **Streamlit File Watcher**: The dynamic execution with `exec()` and string manipulation of the code before execution was likely interfering with Streamlit's file watcher, leading to incorrect path resolution.

### Resolution
The solution involved a combination of simplifying the entry point and making the project root discovery more robust.

1.  **Simplified Entry Point**: The root `streamlit_app.py` was simplified to use `runpy.run_path()` to execute the dashboard script. This is a more robust way to run a Python script as it correctly handles `sys.path` and other module-level attributes.

    ```python
    # streamlit_app.py (root)
    import runpy
    from pathlib import Path

    dashboard_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "hk_port_digital_twin" / "src" / "dashboard" / "streamlit_app.py"
    runpy.run_path(str(dashboard_path), run_name="__main__")
    ```

2.  **Robust Project Root Discovery**: The hardcoded `parents[3]` was replaced with a dynamic `find_project_root()` function in the dashboard's `streamlit_app.py`. This function searches up the directory tree for a known marker (in this case, the presence of both `streamlit_app.py` and the `hk_port_digital_twin` directory), making the logic independent of the environment's specific file structure.

    ```python
    # hk_port_digital_twin/src/dashboard/streamlit_app.py
    from pathlib import Path
    import sys

    def find_project_root(marker_file='streamlit_app.py'):
        current_path = Path(__file__).resolve()
        for parent in current_path.parents:
            if (parent / marker_file).exists() and (parent / 'hk_port_digital_twin').exists():
                return str(parent)
        # Fallback
        for parent in current_path.parents:
            if (parent / 'hk_port_digital_twin').exists():
                return str(parent)
        raise FileNotFoundError("Project root not found.")

    project_root = find_project_root()
    if project_root not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, project_root)
    ```

### Key Learnings
- **Avoid `exec()` for File-Based Scripts**: `exec()` can have subtle side effects on path resolution, especially in cloud environments. `runpy.run_path()` is a much safer and more predictable alternative for running scripts.
- **Dynamic Path Resolution**: Never rely on hardcoded directory structures (`parents[n]`). Always use a dynamic method to find project roots, such as searching for marker files or directories. This makes the code more portable and less prone to environment-specific errors.
- **Streamlit Cloud Environment**: Be aware that the file system structure in Streamlit Cloud can differ from a local development environment. Code that relies on specific path structures is likely to break upon deployment.

## Scenario-Dependent Performance Analytics Implementation

### Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: Performance Analytics section displayed static values regardless of selected scenario (Peak, Normal, Low)
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded values in data generation methods instead of using scenario-specific parameters
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic value ranges based on selected scenario

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Scenario Parameters (`_get_scenario_performance_params`)
Added comprehensive cargo-specific parameters for each scenario:

**Peak Season:**
- Cargo Volume Range: 200,000 - 400,000 TEU
- Revenue Range: $50M - $120M
- Handling Time Range: 8 - 20 hours
- Trade Balance Range: -$80K to +$80K

**Normal Operations:**
- Cargo Volume Range: 120,000 - 280,000 TEU
- Revenue Range: $30M - $80M
- Handling Time Range: 4 - 15 hours
- Trade Balance Range: -$50K to +$50K

**Low Season:**
- Cargo Volume Range: 80,000 - 180,000 TEU
- Revenue Range: $20M - $60M
- Handling Time Range: 3 - 10 hours
- Trade Balance Range: -$30K to +$30K

#### 2. Updated Data Export Section
- Modified berth data generation to use scenario-specific utilization and throughput ranges
- Updated queue data to use scenario-specific waiting time scales
- Enhanced timeline data to reflect scenario parameters

#### 3. Enhanced Cargo Analysis Section
- **New Volume & Revenue Analysis Tab**: Displays scenario-dependent metrics including total cargo volume, revenue, handling times, and trade balance
- **Updated Cargo Types Analysis**: Uses scenario-specific ranges for volume, revenue, and handling time generation
- **Updated Geographic Analysis**: Applies scenario parameters to import/export volume calculations

#### 4. Performance Metrics Integration
- Performance metrics already used scenario-specific KPI ranges
- Radar charts now reflect scenario-dependent performance targets

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Key Methods Modified:
1. `_render_data_export_section()` - Added scenario parameter retrieval and usage
2. `render_cargo_analysis_section()` - Complete restructure with scenario-aware tabs
3. `_render_cargo_volume_revenue_analysis()` - New method with scenario-dependent metrics
4. `_render_cargo_types_analysis()` - Updated to accept and use scenario parameters
5. `_render_locations_analysis()` - Enhanced with scenario-specific volume ranges

#### Data Generation Strategy:
- All random value generation now uses scenario-specific ranges
- Consistent scaling factors applied (e.g., 0.1x to 0.8x of base ranges for different cargo types)
- Maintains realistic relationships between different metrics

### Verification
- Application successfully restarts without errors
- Preview shows no browser errors
- All sections now display values that change based on selected scenario
- Data ranges are appropriate for each scenario type (Peak > Normal > Low)

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding seasonal variations within scenarios
- Implement historical trend analysis
- Add scenario comparison features
- Include confidence intervals for forecasted values

## Error 9: Missing 'Arriving' Vessels in Streamlit UI

### Symptom
- **Issue**: 'Arriving' vessels were not appearing in the Streamlit dashboard despite being present in the raw data files
- **Context**: The `Expected_arrivals.xml` file contained vessel data, but these vessels were not showing up with 'arriving' status in the UI
- **Impact**: Users could not see incoming vessels, limiting the dashboard's real-time monitoring capabilities

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Data Loading Path**: The Streamlit app used `load_all_vessel_data_with_backups()` by default (for "Last 7 days" selection), which internally calls `load_vessel_data_from_xml()`
- **Status Assignment Logic**: In `load_vessel_data_from_xml()` function, the status assignment logic had a flaw:
  ```python
  # Problematic logic in data_loader.py (lines 1532-1540)
  if 'departed' in file_name:
      vessel_data['status'] = 'departed'
  elif 'expected' in file_name:  # This caught Expected_arrivals.xml incorrectly
      vessel_data['status'] = 'expected'
  elif vessel_data.get('remark') == 'Departed':
      vessel_data['status'] = 'departed'
  else:
      vessel_data['status'] = 'in_port'
  ```
- **The Problem**: `Expected_arrivals.xml` contains the substring 'expected', so it was being assigned 'expected' status instead of 'arriving'

### Debugging Process
1. **Initial Investigation**: Used `debug_backup_data.py` to analyze what `load_all_vessel_data_with_backups()` was returning
2. **Data Verification**: Confirmed that 0 'arriving' vessels were found in the default data loading path
3. **Comparison Analysis**: Verified that `load_combined_vessel_data()` correctly identified 'arriving' vessels
4. **Code Inspection**: Traced the data flow to identify the exact location of the status assignment issue

### Resolution
**Solution**: Added a specific condition for 'arriving' vessels in the status assignment logic:

```python
# Fixed logic in load_vessel_data_from_xml() function
if 'departed' in file_name:
    vessel_data['status'] = 'departed'
elif 'expected_arrivals' in file_name:  # âœ… NEW: Specific handling for arriving vessels
    vessel_data['status'] = 'arriving'
elif 'expected' in file_name:
    vessel_data['status'] = 'expected'
elif vessel_data.get('remark') == 'Departed':
    vessel_data['status'] = 'departed'
else:
    vessel_data['status'] = 'in_port'
```

**Implementation Details**:
- **File Modified**: `/hk_port_digital_twin/src/utils/data_loader.py`
- **Lines Changed**: 1532-1540 (added 3 lines)
- **Backup Created**: `data_loader.py.backup` for safety
- **Minimal Impact**: Only affects status assignment for `Expected_arrivals.xml`

### Verification Results
**Before Fix**:
- departed: 1010, expected: 633, in_port: 153, **arriving: 0**

**After Fix**:
- departed: 1008, expected: 372, in_port: 160, **arriving: 288** âœ…

### Key Learnings
1. **Order Matters in Conditional Logic**: When using substring matching for file names, more specific conditions must come before general ones
2. **Default Data Loading Paths**: Understanding which data loading function the UI uses by default is crucial for debugging display issues
3. **Status Assignment Consistency**: Different data loading functions (`load_combined_vessel_data()` vs `load_all_vessel_data_with_backups()`) should assign statuses consistently
4. **Debug Script Value**: Creating targeted debug scripts helps isolate data loading issues without UI complexity
5. **Conservative Approach**: When multiple solutions exist (replace function vs modify function), choose the one that preserves existing functionality and historical data capabilities

### Technical Notes
- **Preserved Functionality**: The fix maintains all existing historical data pipelining and backup file processing
- **Minimal Code Change**: Only 3 lines added, reducing risk of introducing new bugs
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing vessel statuses ('departed', 'expected', 'in_port') continue to work as before
- **Performance Impact**: Negligible - only adds one additional string comparison per vessel record

### Prevention Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Add specific tests for status assignment logic with different XML file names
- **Integration Tests**: Verify that all data loading paths produce consistent vessel status assignments
- **Documentation**: Document the expected status values and their corresponding data sources
