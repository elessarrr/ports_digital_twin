"""Comments for context:
This module defines scenario-specific parameters for the Hong Kong Port Digital Twin simulation.
It extracts realistic operational parameters from historical cargo data to create three distinct
operational scenarios: Peak Season, Normal Operations, and Low Season.

The scenarios are based on 14+ years of historical cargo throughput data and seasonal patterns
identified through the existing _analyze_seasonal_patterns() function in data_loader.py.

This approach ensures that scenario parameters reflect real-world seasonal variations in:
- Ship arrival rates and patterns
- Container volume distributions
- Operational efficiency factors
- Berth utilization targets

The parameters are designed to work with the existing BerthAllocationOptimizer without
modifying its core logic, instead providing scenario-specific inputs that influence
optimization decisions.
