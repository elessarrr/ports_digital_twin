# Strategic Simulations Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of two strategic simulations for the Hong Kong Port Digital Twin dashboard:
1. **Peak Season Capacity Optimization** - Demonstrates strategic capacity planning and AI-driven optimization
2. **Maintenance Window Optimization** - Shows strategic maintenance scheduling to minimize revenue loss

These simulations position the user as a senior management candidate by translating technical capabilities into business value through data-driven decision making.

## Business Objectives

### Peak Season Capacity Optimization
- **Goal**: Demonstrate capacity planning for 40% increase in vessel traffic
- **Business Impact**: Show 35% throughput improvement through AI optimization
- **Key Metrics**: TEU/hour, berth utilization, waiting times, revenue per vessel
- **Strategic Value**: Proves ability to handle growth and optimize operations

### Maintenance Window Optimization
- **Goal**: Minimize revenue loss during equipment maintenance
- **Business Impact**: Reduce maintenance-related losses to <15% of normal operations
- **Key Metrics**: Revenue impact, berth availability, maintenance scheduling efficiency
- **Strategic Value**: Shows business continuity planning and risk management

## Implementation Strategy

### Conservative Approach - HARD RULES
- **RULE 1: ZERO BREAKING CHANGES** - All new code MUST be in separate modules to avoid breaking existing functionality
- **RULE 2: NO EXISTING CODE MODIFICATION** - Existing files can only be extended, never modified directly
- **RULE 3: CONFLICT RESOLUTION** - If there is any conflict with existing code:
  - First attempt: Find a way to merge/integrate without breaking existing functionality
  - If merging is not possible: PAUSE implementation and ask for direction
  - Never force changes that could break existing features
- **RULE 4: REUSE EXISTING FRAMEWORK** - Must reuse existing simulation framework and scenario management
- **RULE 5: ROLLBACK CAPABILITY** - Provide complete rollback capability through modular design
- **RULE 6: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING** - All new functionality must be tested without affecting existing tests

### Code Organization
- New simulation types in `src/scenarios/strategic_simulations.py`
- Business intelligence calculations in `src/analysis/business_intelligence.py`
- Enhanced UI components in `src/dashboard/strategic_dashboard.py`
