## Primary Data Sources (MVP Implementation)

### 1. Hong Kong Government Open Data Portal ‚≠ê
- **URL**: https://data.gov.hk/en-datasets/provider/hk-md
- **Type**: Official government data
- **Access**: Free API
- **Data**: Vessel arrivals/departures, port statistics
- **Update Frequency**: Regular
- **Implementation Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Available for immediate use
- **My Comments**: "I think the Hong Kong government open data portal is quite comprehensive. I looked through the available data sources and when I searched for 'Port', I found a few things like Vessel Arrival and Departure, Port cargo statistics, Port cargo throughput statistics, Port transshipment cargo statistics, Container throughput statistics, Port cargo throughput by Greater Bay Area City statistics, Quarter to quarter percentage change of seasonally adjusted series of Port cargo throughput, Non-convention vessel arrivals and departures, Town planning board guidelines, Port cargo throughput by mode of transport. None of these seem to be API though; mostly files (pdf, csv, xls)"

### 3. Hong Kong Maritime and Port Board ‚≠ê
- **URL**: https://www.hkmpdb.gov.hk/en/port.html
- **Type**: Port authority data
- **Access**: Public portal
- **Data**: Terminal operations, facility information
- **Update Frequency**: Regular
- **Implementation Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Available for immediate use
- **My Comments**: "Not much data here; more like a govt board website with some links to data that seems available in #1 and #2."

## Enhanced Data Sources (Future Implementation)

### 4. MarineTraffic API üö¢
- **URL**: https://www.marinetraffic.com/
- **Type**: Commercial AIS data provider
- **Access**: Paid API (free tier available)
- **Data**: Real-time vessel tracking, AIS data
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time
- **Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Cost**: Free tier: 1,000 API calls/month, Paid plans from $99/month
- **Status**: üîÑ Evaluation phase
- **My Comments**: "Pretty visualization, but I don't see a free tier. There are three seven days, but I can't use that because I would need more than seven days to build and test the feature before rolling it out in the demo. We're going to pay the entry-level API here if we can find something useful to do with it. Maybe something around real-time shipping data. Okay, today is the day of the demo. This is real-time data from today. This is what it looks like. It's going to happen today. Now let's assume XYZ and then pull up the visualization. But that is a five-fetched. Again, it's more for the visuals, which maybe the business audience doesn't care so much for. Perhaps just a screenshot or a live view of the ships would be enough."

### 5. OpenAIS
- **URL**: https://open-ais.org/
- **Type**: Open-source AIS tools
- **Access**: Free
- **Data**: AIS data processing tools
- **Update Frequency**: Community-driven
- **Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: üîÑ Evaluation phase

### 6. AISViz Project
- **URL**: https://github.com/AISViz
- **Type**: Research initiative
- **Access**: Open-source
- **Data**: Vessel tracking visualization tools
- **Update Frequency**: Project-based
- **Implementation Priority**: LOW
- **Status**: üìã Research phase

## Optional Enhancements

### Real-Time Map Integration üó∫Ô∏è

#### MarineTraffic Live Map Embedding
- **Purpose**: Visual enhancement for dashboard
- **Implementation**: Iframe embedding or API integration
- **Benefits**: 
  - Real-time vessel visualization
  - Professional maritime interface
  - User engagement enhancement
- **Considerations**:
  - Requires API subscription for commercial use
  - May need custom styling to match dashboard theme
  - Performance impact on dashboard loading

#### Implementation Options:

**Option A: Iframe Embedding (Simplest)**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/embed/zoom:10/centery:22.3/centerx:114.2/maptype:4/shownames:false/mmsi:0/shipid:0/fleet:0/fleet_hide_old_positions:false/fleet_hide_fishing_vessels:false/fleet_hide_passenger_vessels:false"
  width="100%" 
  height="400px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

**Option B: API Integration (Advanced)**
- Use MarineTraffic API for vessel data
- Custom map implementation with Leaflet/Mapbox
- Full control over styling and functionality

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Use free tier API for basic vessel data
- Combine with open-source mapping libraries
- Fallback to static data when API limits reached

### Container Terminal Operator APIs

#### Modern Terminals Ltd (MTL)
- **Contact**: cad@ModernTerminals.com
- **Data**: Terminal operations, berth availability
- **Access**: Direct partnership required

#### Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT)
- **Location**: Terminal 4, Container Port Road South
- **Data**: 12 berths operations data
- **Access**: Commercial agreement needed

#### COSCO-HIT Terminals
- **Location**: CHT Tower, Terminal 8 East
- **Data**: Joint venture operations
- **Access**: Partnership required

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)

- ‚úÖ Basic simulation engine
- ‚úÖ Dashboard framework

### Phase 2: Government Data Integration
- üîÑ Hong Kong Open Data Portal API
- üîÑ Marine Department statistics
- üîÑ HKMPB data integration

### Phase 3: Real-Time Enhancements
- üìã MarineTraffic API evaluation
- üìã Live map integration
- üìã Real-time vessel tracking

### Phase 4: Commercial Partnerships
- üìã Terminal operator data access
- üìã Enhanced operational metrics
- üìã Predictive analytics

## Technical Considerations

### API Rate Limits
- Government APIs: Generally unlimited for public data
- MarineTraffic: 1,000 calls/month (free), higher limits with paid plans
- Commercial APIs: Varies by provider

### Data Refresh Rates
- Real-time: Every 1-5 minutes (vessel positions)
- Operational: Every 15-30 minutes (berth status)
- Statistical: Daily/weekly (performance metrics)

### Storage Requirements
- Historical data: ~1GB per year for basic metrics
- Real-time cache: ~100MB for active vessels
- Map tiles: ~500MB for Hong Kong region

## Security & Compliance

### Data Privacy
- No personal information collection
- Vessel tracking uses public AIS data
- Compliance with Hong Kong data protection laws

### API Security
- Environment variables for API keys
- Rate limiting implementation
- Error handling for API failures

## Cost Estimation

### Free Tier (MVP)
- Government data: $0
- OpenAIS tools: $0
- Basic MarineTraffic: $0 (limited)
- **Total**: $0/month

### Enhanced Tier
- MarineTraffic Professional: $99/month
- Additional APIs: $50-200/month
- **Total**: $150-300/month

### Enterprise Tier
- Full MarineTraffic access: $500+/month
- Terminal operator partnerships: Variable
- **Total**: $1000+/month

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement government data sources
2. **Short-term**: Evaluate MarineTraffic free tier
3. **Medium-term**: Prototype live map integration
4. **Long-term**: Establish commercial partnerships
