**Key Message:**
Leveraging machine learning to translate historical data into forward-looking, data-driven strategy.

**Script:**
"A key capability of the digital twin is its ability to forecast future trends. This moves us beyond simply looking at historical data and into the realm of predictive strategy.

Here, we see a strategic forecast of cargo volume. We're using time-series models to predict throughput for the coming years based on a decade of historical data. This isn't just a simple trend line; it's a model that has been trained and validated, achieving an average accuracy of nearly 78%. More importantly, it allows us to quantify the dominant trend—in this case, a projected decrease. This is a critical insight for long-term port strategy and investment planning.

**(For the hiring managers and recruiters in the audience):** This demonstrates an end-to-end capability: from data ingestion and cleaning, to model selection and training, to quantitative evaluation, and finally, to the extraction of actionable business insights. It’s the core skillset required to build and deploy data-driven products.

**(For the academics and professors):** While this example shows a high-level strategic forecast, the underlying framework is designed to be extensible. The same methodologies can be applied to create more granular, operational forecasts—such as predicting vessel queue lengths or berth waiting times, which opens up fascinating areas for further research and collaboration.

Ultimately, this predictive capability is what allows a digital twin to become a powerful tool for proactive decision-making, enabling stakeholders to anticipate challenges and opportunities rather than just reacting to them."

**Key Message:**
Domain expertise combined with AI-assisted development creates more relevant and valuable solutions than pure technical approaches.

**Script:**
"There's a crucial insight here: while developers can build graphs and dashboards, domain experts who build their own tools can iterate faster and notice when something doesn't make sense. Technical correctness isn't enough—you need domain knowledge to make solutions relevant and valuable. This project demonstrates how vibe coding enables domain experts to bridge the gap between business understanding and technical implementation.

A perfect example of this is how we architected the vessel insights system to serve different audiences with minimal additional effort. The operations tab focuses on the last 3 days of arrivals—perfect for short-term operational decisions. But because we built modular code from the start, we could easily configure a separate backup process that archives every download automatically. This created a rich historical dataset that powers our strategic tab with months of trend analysis, all without impacting the regular operational downloads. The same underlying data infrastructure serves both immediate operational needs and long-term strategic planning. This efficiency—building once and serving multiple stakeholder needs—only comes from combining domain understanding with thoughtful technical architecture."
