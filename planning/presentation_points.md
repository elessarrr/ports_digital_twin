# Presentation Points - Port Digital Twin Project

## Key Insights and Observations

• **Domain Expertise in Dashboard Development**: While developers and software can build graphs and dashboards, the value of domain experts building it themselves is they can iterate faster and notice when things don't make sense. Technically it 'is' a graph and it works, but it takes domain expertise to make it 'right' and 'relevant'.

• **Custom Data Validation**: Built-in error handling and data quality checks
• **Government Data Integration**: Direct integration with Hong Kong Marine Department XML feeds
• **Automated File Monitoring**: Watchdog-based system for detecting new data files automatically

### 2. AI-Powered Optimization & Predictive Analytics
• **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - Ship arrival prediction using statistical models
  - Processing time estimation with seasonal patterns
