# Band/Threshold System Implementation Plan

## Goal Understanding

**Objective**: Replace the current exponential scale and multiplier system in `scenario_aware_calculator.py` with a logical band/threshold system for wait time calculations.

**Business Rationale**: The current system produces counterintuitive results where "Peak Season" has lower wait times (1.8 scale) than "Normal Operations" (2.8 scale) and "Low Season" (4.2 scale). This contradicts real-world expectations where peak seasons should have higher wait times due to increased traffic and congestion.

**Technical Reason**: The exponential scale system with complex multipliers creates unpredictable and illogical wait time distributions. A band/threshold system will provide more predictable, business-logical wait time ranges.

## Conservative Approach

**Existing Functionality Preservation**:
- Maintain all existing method signatures and return types
- Preserve the existing range-based parameter structure already used for other metrics
- Keep the existing validation framework intact
- Ensure backward compatibility with all calling code

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Create backup of original exponential scale logic as commented code
- Implement new logic in separate methods initially
- Use feature flags to switch between old and new systems during testing
- Maintain existing parameter names where possible

**Leverage Existing Infrastructure**:
- Reuse the existing range-based pattern used for `throughput_range`, `utilization_range`, etc.
- Extend the current validation framework for range checking
- Build upon the existing scenario parameter structure

## Implementation Strategy

**Modular Design**:
- Create new `_generate_band_based_waiting_times()` method alongside existing `_generate_enhanced_waiting_times()`
- Implement new `_get_wait_time_bands()` method to define threshold ranges
- Add new `_validate_wait_time_bands()` method for logical ordering validation
- Import and integrate only where needed, keeping changes isolated

**Isolation Benefits**:
- Easy rollback by switching method calls
- Reduced risk of breaking existing functionality
- Clear separation between old and new logic
- Facilitates A/B testing if needed

## Pre-Creation Checks

**Existing Code Analysis**:
✅ **Found**: `scenario_aware_calculator.py` already uses range-based patterns for other metrics
✅ **Found**: Existing validation framework in `_validate_scenario_ranges()` method
✅ **Found**: Current wait time logic in `_generate_enhanced_waiting_times()` method (lines 410-550)
✅ **Found**: Scenario parameter structure supports range definitions

**Reusable Components**:
- Range validation logic from existing `_validate_scenario_ranges()` method
- Parameter structure pattern from `throughput_range`, `utilization_range`, etc.
- Statistical calculation patterns from existing methods
- Error handling and logging patterns

## Code Minimalism Principle

**Minimal Changes Required**:
1. Add new band/threshold parameters to existing scenario parameter dictionaries
2. Create one new method for band-based wait time generation
3. Update one method call in the wait time generation logic
4. Extend existing validation method with new band validation

**Avoid Feature Creep**:
- Focus only on wait time calculation changes
- Do not modify other metric calculations
- Do not add unnecessary configuration options
- Keep the same statistical output format

## Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Define Wait Time Band Structure
**File**: `src/utils/scenario_aware_calculator.py`
**Lines**: ~100-226 (scenario parameter definitions)

**Purpose**: Replace exponential scale parameters with logical wait time bands that follow Peak > Normal > Low ordering.

**Context**: The current system uses `waiting_time_exponential_scale` values of 1.8 (Peak), 2.8 (Normal), 4.2 (Low) which creates inverted logic. We need to define wait time bands that make business sense.

**What to do**:
- Replace `waiting_time_exponential_scale` with `waiting_time_bands` in each scenario
- Define logical threshold ranges: Peak (8-20 hours), Normal (4-12 hours), Low (1-6 hours)
- Remove `seasonal_multiplier` as it will be built into the bands
- Keep `max_waiting_time` as an absolute ceiling for safety

**Why this approach**:
- Bands provide predictable, business-logical wait time ranges
- Eliminates the mathematical complexity of exponential scaling
- Makes the system more transparent and easier to understand
- Follows the existing pattern used for other metrics in the same file

### Step 2: Create Band-Based Wait Time Generation Method
**File**: `src/utils/scenario_aware_calculator.py`
**Lines**: After line 550 (new method)

**Purpose**: Create a new method that generates wait times using band/threshold logic instead of exponential scaling.

**Context**: The current `_generate_enhanced_waiting_times()` method uses complex gamma distribution calculations with exponential scaling. We need a simpler, more predictable approach.

**What to do**:
- Create `_generate_band_based_waiting_times(params, count)` method
- Use uniform distribution within defined bands for base wait times
- Apply time-of-day variations (rush hours vs. off-peak)
- Apply ship size multipliers (larger ships = longer processing)
- Ensure minimum wait time of 0.1 hours and respect maximum ceiling

**Why this approach**:
- Uniform distribution within bands is more predictable than gamma distribution
- Maintains existing variation factors (time-of-day, ship size) for realism
- Simpler logic is easier to debug and maintain
- Provides consistent results that match business expectations

### Step 3: Update Wait Time Band Parameters
**File**: `src/utils/scenario_aware_calculator.py`
**Lines**: ~100-226 (within existing scenario parameter dictionaries)

**Purpose**: Replace the current exponential scale parameters with logical wait time bands for each scenario.

**Context**: Each scenario currently has `waiting_time_exponential_scale`, `seasonal_multiplier`, and `max_waiting_time`. We need to replace these with band definitions.

**What to do**:
- **Peak Season**: Replace with `waiting_time_bands: (8, 20)` (high congestion, longer waits)
- **Normal Operations**: Replace with `waiting_time_bands: (4, 12)` (moderate waits)
- **Low Season**: Replace with `waiting_time_bands: (1, 6)` (minimal waits, quick processing)
- Keep `max_waiting_time` values as absolute ceilings
- Remove `seasonal_multiplier` and `waiting_time_exponential_scale`

**Why this approach**:
- Creates logical Peak > Normal > Low ordering for wait times
- Aligns with real-world port operations where peak seasons have more congestion
- Follows the existing range pattern used throughout the parameter system
- Eliminates the confusing exponential scale mathematics

### Step 4: Integrate Band-Based Logic into Wait Time Generation
**File**: `src/utils/scenario_aware_calculator.py`
**Lines**: ~420-430 (within `_generate_enhanced_waiting_times` method)

**Purpose**: Replace the exponential scale logic with a call to the new band-based method.

**Context**: The current method has complex gamma distribution calculations using exponential scaling. We need to replace this core logic while maintaining the same method signature.

**What to do**:
- Comment out the existing gamma distribution logic (lines ~430-480)
- Add call to `_generate_band_based_waiting_times(params, count)`
- Keep the existing ship size multiplier logic (lines ~480-500)
- Keep the existing time-of-day variation logic
- Maintain the same return format and data types

**Why this approach**:
- Maintains backward compatibility with all calling code
- Preserves existing variation factors that add realism
- Allows easy rollback by uncommenting old logic
- Keeps the same statistical output format

### Step 5: Extend Validation Framework for Wait Time Bands
**File**: `src/utils/scenario_aware_calculator.py`
**Lines**: ~1000-1048 (within `_validate_scenario_ranges` method)

**Purpose**: Add validation logic to ensure wait time bands follow logical Peak > Normal > Low ordering.

**Context**: The existing validation method checks range ordering for other metrics. We need to add wait time band validation to prevent configuration errors.

**What to do**:
- Add `waiting_time_bands` to the list of validated parameters
- Implement band overlap checking (Peak min > Normal max, Normal min > Low max)
- Add validation for band width (ensure reasonable spread within each band)
- Include validation error messages specific to wait time bands

**Why this approach**:
- Prevents configuration errors that could recreate the current logical inconsistency
- Follows the existing validation pattern used for other metrics
- Provides clear error messages for debugging
- Ensures system integrity during parameter updates

### Step 6: Update Method Documentation and Comments
**File**: `src/utils/scenario_aware_calculator.py`
**Lines**: Method docstrings and inline comments

**Purpose**: Update documentation to reflect the new band-based approach and remove references to exponential scaling.

**Context**: The current documentation describes exponential scaling and gamma distributions. This needs to be updated to describe the new band-based approach.

**What to do**:
- Update class docstring to describe band-based wait time generation
- Update `_generate_enhanced_waiting_times` method docstring
- Add comprehensive docstring for new `_generate_band_based_waiting_times` method
- Update inline comments to explain band logic instead of exponential scaling
- Add comments explaining the business logic behind band ranges

**Why this approach**:
- Ensures future developers understand the new system
- Provides context for the business logic behind band ranges
- Maintains code documentation standards
- Helps with debugging and maintenance

### Step 7: Test Band-Based System with Streamlit App
**File**: Streamlit application testing
**Lines**: N/A (testing phase)

**Purpose**: Verify that the new band-based system produces logical wait time results in the Streamlit dashboard.

**Context**: The Streamlit app currently shows counterintuitive results where Peak Season has lower wait times. We need to verify the fix works correctly.

**What to do**:
- Run the Streamlit application
- Navigate to the Ship Queue Analysis section
- Generate data for all three scenarios (Peak, Normal, Low)
- Verify that wait times follow logical ordering: Peak > Normal > Low
- Check that wait time statistics are within expected band ranges
- Verify that other metrics remain unaffected

**Why this approach**:
- Provides immediate visual confirmation that the fix works
- Ensures no regression in other functionality
- Validates the business logic in a real-world context
- Confirms user-facing improvements

### Step 8: Performance and Edge Case Testing
**File**: `src/utils/scenario_aware_calculator.py`
**Lines**: All wait time generation methods

**Purpose**: Ensure the new band-based system performs well and handles edge cases correctly.

**Context**: The new system should be at least as performant as the old system and handle edge cases like very small or very large ship counts.

**What to do**:
- Test with various ship counts (1, 10, 100, 1000)
- Verify performance is comparable to exponential scale system
- Test edge cases: zero ships, negative parameters, invalid bands
- Ensure error handling works correctly
- Verify statistical outputs are reasonable across all scenarios

**Why this approach**:
- Ensures system reliability under various conditions
- Prevents performance regressions
- Validates error handling and edge case management
- Confirms statistical integrity of the new approach
