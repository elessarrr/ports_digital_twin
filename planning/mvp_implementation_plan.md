# Hong Kong Port Digital Twin - MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document provides a conservative, step-by-step approach to implement the Hong Kong Port Digital Twin MVP. The plan prioritizes safety, modularity, and easy rollback capabilities.

## Core Principles
- **Conservative Development**: Never break existing functionality
- **Modular Design**: All new code in separate, importable modules
- **Easy Rollback**: Git-based version control with clear checkpoints
- **Minimal Code**: Write only what's necessary for MVP functionality
- **Safety First**: Test each component independently before integration

## MVP Scope (Weeks 1-4)
Build a working simulation with:
1. Basic port structure and configuration
2. Ship arrival and processing simulation
3. Simple berth allocation
4. Basic visualization dashboard
5. Sample data for offline development

## Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Initialize git repository in `/Port/` directory
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` file
- [ ] Set up virtual environment
- [ ] Document current state (baseline)

---

## Phase 1: Project Foundation (Week 1)

### Step 1.1: Directory Structure Setup (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Create the basic project structure without affecting existing files

**Actions**:
1. Navigate to `/Port/` directory
2. Create the following structure:
   ```
   hk_port_digital_twin/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── raw/
   │   ├── processed/
   │   └── sample/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── core/
   │   │   └── __init__.py
   │   ├── utils/
   │   │   └── __init__.py
   │   └── dashboard/
   │       └── __init__.py
   ├── tests/
   ├── config/
   └── docs/
   ```

**Safety Notes**:
- Keep existing `dev/` folder untouched
- All new code goes in `hk_port_digital_twin/` subdirectory
- Use relative imports within the new structure

**Validation**:
- Verify directory structure matches plan
- Ensure no existing files were modified
- Test that you can navigate to all new directories

### Step 1.2: Git Repository Initialization (15 minutes)
**Goal**: Set up version control for safe development

**Actions**:
1. Initialize git in `/Port/hk_port_digital_twin/`
2. Create `.gitignore` with:
   ```
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   *.pyo
   *.pyd
   .Python
   env/
   venv/
   .venv/
   .env
   .DS_Store
   *.log
   data/raw/*
   !data/raw/.gitkeep
   ```
3. Create initial commit: "Initial project structure"

**Safety Notes**:
- Only initialize git within the new project directory
- Don't affect any parent directory git settings
- Keep sensitive data out of version control

### Step 1.3: Requirements and Configuration (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Set up dependencies and basic configuration

**Actions**:
1. Create `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   streamlit==1.28.0
   plotly==5.17.0
   pandas==2.1.0
   numpy==1.24.0
   simpy==4.0.1
   requests==2.31.0
   python-dotenv==1.0.0
   ```

2. Create `config/settings.py`:
   ```python
   """
   Configuration settings for Hong Kong Port Digital Twin
   
   This module contains all configuration parameters for the port simulation.
   Modify these values to adjust simulation behavior without changing core logic.
   """
   
   # Port Configuration
   PORT_CONFIG = {
       'num_berths': 8,
       'berth_capacity': 5000,  # TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units)
       'operating_hours': 24,   # Hours per day
   }
   
   # Ship Types and Characteristics
   SHIP_TYPES = {
       'container': {
           'min_size': 1000,
           'max_size': 20000,
           'processing_rate': 100,  # TEU per hour
       },
       'bulk': {
           'min_size': 5000,
           'max_size': 50000,
           'processing_rate': 200,  # Tons per hour
       }
   }
   
   # Simulation Parameters
   SIMULATION_CONFIG = {
       'time_unit': 'hours',
       'default_duration': 168,  # 1 week in hours
       'ship_arrival_rate': 2,   # Ships per hour
   }
   ```

3. Create `.env.example`:
   ```
   # API Keys (copy to .env and add real values)
   MARINE_TRAFFIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   HK_MARINE_DEPT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # Development Settings
   DEBUG=True
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```

**Safety Notes**:
- Use `.env` for secrets, never commit actual API keys
- Keep configuration separate from logic
- Use sensible defaults that work offline

**Validation**:
- Install requirements in virtual environment
- Import settings.py successfully
- Verify no syntax errors

### Step 1.4: Sample Data Creation (2 hours)
**Goal**: Create realistic sample data for offline development

**Actions**:
1. Create `data/sample/ships.csv`:
   ```csv
   ship_id,ship_name,ship_type,size_teu,arrival_time,containers_to_unload,containers_to_load
   1,HK_EXPRESS_001,container,15000,2024-01-01 08:00,800,600
   2,BULK_CARRIER_002,bulk,25000,2024-01-01 10:30,0,1200
   3,CONTAINER_003,container,8000,2024-01-01 14:15,400,300
   ```

2. Create `data/sample/berths.csv`:
   ```csv
   berth_id,berth_name,max_capacity_teu,crane_count,berth_type
   1,Berth_A1,20000,4,container
   2,Berth_A2,20000,4,container
   3,Berth_B1,30000,2,bulk
   4,Berth_B2,30000,2,bulk
   ```

3. Create `src/utils/sample_data_generator.py`:
   ```python
   """
   Sample Data Generator for Hong Kong Port Digital Twin
   
   This module generates realistic sample data for development and testing.
   Use this when real APIs are unavailable or for offline development.
   """
   
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   import random
   
   def generate_ship_arrivals(num_ships=50, start_date=None):
       """Generate sample ship arrival data"""
       # Implementation details...
   
   def generate_berth_schedule(num_days=7):
       """Generate sample berth scheduling data"""
       # Implementation details...
   ```

**Safety Notes**:
- Keep sample data realistic but not based on real sensitive information
- Use clearly marked sample/test data
- Ensure sample data works without external dependencies

**Validation**:
- Load sample CSV files successfully
- Generate additional sample data programmatically
- Verify data formats match expected schemas

   """
   
   import simpy
   from .ship_manager import ShipManager, Ship
   from .berth_manager import BerthManager
   from .container_handler import ContainerHandler
   
   class PortSimulation:
       """Main simulation controller"""
       
       def __init__(self, config: Dict):
           self.env = simpy.Environment()
           self.config = config
           self.ship_manager = ShipManager(self.env)
           self.berth_manager = BerthManager(self.env, config['berths'])
           self.container_handler = ContainerHandler(self.env)
           self.metrics = {}
           
       def run_simulation(self, duration: float):
           """Run simulation for specified duration"""
           # Implementation...
           
       def ship_arrival_process(self):
           """Generate ship arrivals over time"""
           # Implementation...
   ```

   """
   
   from enum import Enum
   import threading
   import time
   
   class SimulationState(Enum):
       STOPPED = "stopped"
       RUNNING = "running"
       PAUSED = "paused"
       COMPLETED = "completed"
   
   class SimulationController:
       """High-level simulation control"""
       
       def __init__(self, port_simulation):
           self.simulation = port_simulation
           self.state = SimulationState.STOPPED
           self.thread = None
