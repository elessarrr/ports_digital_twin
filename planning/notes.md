##Challenges
- The data had to be downloaded one file at a time because most of the sources did not label the files correctly. They were labeled in some machine language. So I had to download them one at a time and label them correctly to have a data set that I could actually understand and build code around. 
    -   If I tried to select multiple files and 'Download selected' or 'Download all'; still I would only get 1 file. I didn't have time to debug it, but that's another reason why I had to do it 1 at a time. 
    - Funny thing - I spent more time trying to automate a way to download all these files than it took to just download them manually 1 by 1 ^^.
